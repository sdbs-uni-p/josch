/*
  This stylesheet is used to define the colors of the main colors of the application. All colors
  used are supposed to meet the requirements of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) from
  the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).  Even though the application is no web application, these
  WCAG are suited best for graphical user interfaces.

  Note on the naming convention: Variables in regular css are defined as --variable-name and
  are accessed via var(--variable-name). JavaFX css slightly differs from regular css. By their
  naming convention variable names should be named and with both: -fx-variable-name, which this
  application tries to stick to.
